Signal is an interactive portfolio built as a multi-service system. Instead of a static page, it gives you a conversational way to explore my work, projects, and leadership experience. Under the hood, it demonstrates how I approach frontend craft, system design, and modern AI workflows.

## Why?

Signal is a proof point. It shows how I design systems that balance clarity, maintainability, and developer experience, while experimenting with modern AI patterns like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

It's less about shipping a product and more about demonstrating service boundaries, shared standards, and production-minded practices in a portfolio context.

## Why it matters

Signal is both portfolio and proof point. It shows my **frontend expertise** through a polished, real-time chat interface. It demonstrates **system-level thinking** with clear service boundaries and shared standards. It reflects a **leadership mindset** by focusing on maintainable, documented systems that align with real-world production practices.

At a higher level, Signal reflects how I think about building systems that balance **clarity, maintainability, and team enablement**.
